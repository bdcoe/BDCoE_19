28 august Kafka Architecture


there are two types of messaging system:
	1. point to point 
	   In this system message is sent to every intended reciever
	2. publisher to subscriber
	   In this system all messages are send to a broker. the broker handles the messages.
	   when a subscriber wants messages it is provided by the broker.

How does it work ?
	   In this messaging system producers send their messages to brokers.
	   messages are divided in topics. each topic is assigned brokers. these brokers store the messages in pieces.
	   a message is broken into pieces, these pieces are stored in the partitions by broker.
	   the brokers addreses the pieces by offsets. 
	   when a topic data is requested. a message is assembled by its offsets in the partitions.
	   ans it is send back.

creating an elementry application

1. starting zookeeper
	cd /usr/local/kafka
	./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
2. starting kafka server
	cd /usr/local/kafka
	./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
3. creating a topic
	./bin/kafka-topics.sh  --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic karan --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1

4. starting console producer
	./bin/kafka-topics.sh  --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic karan --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1

5. starting console consumer

now any text written in producer console appears in consumer console
