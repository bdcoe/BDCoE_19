##SPARK
->spark is better than hadoop as
*process data in real time can be done faster
*easy to use as compasre hadoop	
*fastrt processing speed

spark  make blocks of default memory space of 128 MB

->IN spark ata is convergted in the RDD(resilient disturbed data)
rdd is resilient. resilient means reliable as they make the copy of different among them.in any one get lost we can recover them from other blocck

RDD is immutable
RDD is consistence
RDD help to manage fault or corrupted file from the data set
 1 operation requires 1RDD

##operation of RDD
1. transforme->mapping
2. action ->action or operation

##
saprk can run with
1. HDMS
2. YARN
3. ALONE ALONE WITHOUT USING HADOOP

##
WE CANNOT REPLCE HADoop with sparks as spark uses hadoop file system like HDMS AND YARN to do the operation .
sapr is just a extension of hadoop

##SPARK FEATURES
1. speed
2. polygot-can use multiple language
3. advanced analyst
4. memory computation
5. hadoop integration
6. machine learing
7. lazy action

##SPARKS ECOSYSTEM
1. SPARK CORE
2. SPARK STREAMING
3. SPARK SQL
4. MLlib
5. grapgx

##
data source api
2. data frame api
3. interpeter &optimizer
4. sql service

ml lib 3 technique
1. classificAtion
2. clustering
3. collaboration filering
