in the project i have used the following libraries
 1. import socket libraries-> socket is a way of connecting two node on a network vto communi te with each other
    one socket listen to a particular port at an ip,while another socket reach to other to form connection
server from a listen socket while client reachres out to srtver

import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket_STREAM)

here socket.AF_INET->refers to the address familt ivp4
socket,STREAM->refers to the port /TCP portol

to find the ip we use
ip=socket.gethostbyname('www.gogle.com')

to connectto serve we use
s.connect((host_ip,port))

to print we use

print "on port=%s"% (host_ip)

output
on port=173.194.40.19
