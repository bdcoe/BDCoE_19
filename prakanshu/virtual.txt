virtualisation
##two types
type 1
 type 1 consist of hardware then os then virtual machine which is know as hypervision then on hypervision we can install various type of  operating system in it.
type 2
in type 2 we have hardware then we have hypervision and on hypervision we are installing various typrs of opearting system .

##ADVANTAGE OF TYPE 2 OVER TYPE 1 VIRTUALISATION
in type 1 in we allocate 8gb ram to a particular operating system then is it utilise complete 8gb ram but the sinerio is different in the type 2 operarting system . in type 2 oprerating system if we allocate 8gb ram to a particular oprating system then it will initial only the memory it required not the whole memory at a time

BUT

type 1 virtualisation is faster than type 2 virtualisation.

#kernel- the core program of operating system.

#OPERATING SYSTEM
*memory management operating system
*process mnAGEMENT operating system
*file storage operating system 
* storage management operating system

##internet also works by virtualisation
