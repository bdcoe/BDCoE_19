 

	Git is a distributed version control system . It is used for tracking changes in development program.It is designed for 	coordinating work among programmers.
 
	The basic idea is that at certain point we want to make changes in a well running program, then you just copy it and save it,
	so that your code gets wrong then u have a backup which is also called local version control.

	but it has some drawbacks as the whole data is on a single hardware so if system gets corrupted then ur code gets lost.
	And if ur project contains many files then u would not be able to find that which file is where...

	So there was a need of server where data can store,then  there comes a centralised version control
	but it has a single point of failure i.e. if a master server gets corrupted then at that time noone would be able to access 		it.
	
	Distributed Version Control :  In it the data is distributed, so there is no scope of single point of failure.

	
	GitHub is a cloud based platform built around git i.e. Git is a tool and Github is a service using that tool.



	Some basic git commannds ->

	git init                 ->
	git add .		 -> prepare for adding files in staging area
	git status 		 -> tracks the unstaged files
	git commit -m " "	 ->  add the files in staging area
	git checkout -b <branch name>->creates and shifts to that branch
	git push origin branch   -> pushes the staged files in that branch
	git clone url 		 -> clone the files i.e. from remote to local
