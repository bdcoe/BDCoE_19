	Virtaulisation in operating system means using a software for running different operating system in a single computer system.
	It means we can run different different applicaltions requiring different operating system concurrently.
	The operating systems donot interfere in their works i.e. for accessing hardware.
	
	There are two types of virtualistion in operating system:-
	1. Type1 virtualisation 
	2. Type2 virtualisation

	Type1 virtualisation -> In this type , there is a main operating system which is also called host operating sytem.
				and the other operating systems are present in virtual box,vmware etc..

		merits ->  If system gets corrupted then there is no effect on hardware.
			   We can take snapshots to recover our lost one.

		demerit -> As there is no direct access to hardware, so there is a lack of speed.



	Type2 virtualisation  -> In this one , there is no main operating system. On the hardware there is a layer of hypervisor
				 which is used for managing the processors,memory so that it can supply to os what they want.

		merits -> As there is a direct access with hardware so you will experience a good speed.

		demerits -> If system gets corrupted ,then all the impact can also be seen on hardware,and data can also be lost.
