kafka is basically a collection of topics partitioned in smaller messages.
 
 WORkING:
 
step1: The producer sends a message
step2: then the message is partioned and stored in kafka brokers 
step3: then consumer wil send a pull request to the kafka broker.
step4: Zookeeper will identify which partition is well for the read or write operation and sends a offset no. of that partition.
step5: consumer receives the message for the operations.
step6:after consumer performs its computation,it sends an aknowelegdement to the Zookeeper that the task has been done.
step7:after receiving the aknowlegdment kafka changes its offset and again sends it to consumer.
step8:consumer also have the right to skip or rewinds the message.
              
ZOOKEPER:
Zookeeper keeps an track of all the partitions.Zookeeper serves as the  interface between the Kafka brokers and consumers. 
kafka stors various metadata in zookeeper as offset no.,topics,partitions etc.The leader election is also done by zookeper.
since information is stored in the Zookeeper so it  replicates this data across its ensemble,in case failure of Kafka broker
 Zookeeper does not affect the state of the Kafka cluster. Kafka will restore the state, once the Zookeeper restarts. 
This gives zero downtime for Kafka. The leader election between the Kafka broker is also done by using Zookeeper in the 
event of leader failure.
