hadoop1:
       *uses HDFS(hadoop distributed file system) for storage.
       *uses MAP REDUCE for processing of data.
       *Is based on master slave architecture,i.e all slaves connected to a single masterand if master dies or become deactivated,
        wholesystem dies and files and meta data which master keeps get deteriorated.
       *Daemons:
          #NAMENODE
          #DATANODE
          #SECONDARY NAMENODE
          #JOB TRACKER
          #DATA TRACKER
HADOOP2:
       *uses HDFS for storage
       *uses YARN(yet another resource negotiater) for managing data storage.
       *Is also based on master slave architecture but consists of standby namenodes so that if one namenode got crashed,other can
        take the responsibility.
       *Daemons:
           #NAMENODE
           #DATANODE
           #SEC.NAMENODE
           #RESOURSE MANAGER
           #NODE MANAGER
