Hadoop is one of the big data tools which is helpful in storage and processing of large amount of data.It is an opensurce framework that 
works on the distributed file system i.e.a large file is divided into sub parts of equal size and after there processing they are again
combined for the final processing.Hadoop works on master-slave architecture i.e. one system is considered as the master which divides the
data among the rest of the systems which are considered as it's slaves.
The processing speed can be inceased in two ways:Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling.
1.Vertical Scaling:It is the process of updating the hardware of a single system in order to increase its memory.
2.Horizontal Scaling:It is the process in which large amount of data is divided into parts so that the processing time can be decreased.
Large amount of data is stored in the master system and parts of data are stored in slaves.Master contains the meta data.
The two differant versions of hadoop are hadoop1 and hadoop2.
HADOOP1:
It has two parts:
1.HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System):It is used for storage of data.
2.Map Reduce:It works for processing of data as well as resource management.
Daemons:
1.Name Node:Mater Daemon
2.Data Node
3.Secondary Name Node
4.Job tracker
5.Task tracker

HADOOP 2:
It has two parts:
1.HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System):It is used for storage of data.
2.YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator):It works as resource management.
Daemons:
1.Name Node:Master Daemon
2.Data Node
3.Secondary Name Node:FS Image+Edit Logs.
4.Resource Manager
5.Node Manager

Difference:In Hadoop1,if the master system fails then the entire system gets failed(single point of failure) while in Hadoop2,if the master
system gets failed the secondary name node can acts as a backup.Hadoop1 is slower than Hadoop2 as it forms clusters which is time consuming
and a lot of memory space is required for this purpose.
