Kernel is the core part of operating system.Linux is the kernel and the
operating system is ubuntu.Linux is an open source software and it is
available for free.

Comparison between  Ubuntu and Windows:-
1.In Ubuntu there are no drives like those present in windows.There are only
files or folders.
2.In ubuntu two files can have same name with the change in case but it is not
possible in windows.

The advantages are as follows:
1.Available for free.
2.Usage is less as compared to windows so it is virus free.
3.Renaming of file can be done alongwith editing.

In ubuntu before running a file we need to make it executable and for this
permission is required.Permission is given in 9 digits.First three are for 
users,next three for group and the last three for others.
r: for reading
w: for writing
x: for execution of file
If x is not present in the three digits of user than the group and other users 
can't access the file.

.m is used for hiding the file.
