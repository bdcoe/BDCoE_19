Big data is a term used for the collection of data which is very large in size
(of the range>terabytes)and is very complex.The processing of such type of data
becomes very complex.
The five V's of big data are:
1.Volume
2.Variety(Structured,Unstructured,Semi-structured)
3.Velocity(processing of data at a very high speed)
4.Varacity(Accuracy)
5.Value

Problem:-Large amount of data can't be stored in a system.If stored,then its processing becomes very difficult.So for the proper storage of 
data and its processing we use Big data technology.

The various tools or technologies are:-
1.Apache Hadoop
2.Spark
3.Kafka
4.Mongo DB
5.Hive
6.Pig etc.
