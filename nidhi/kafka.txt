Kafka is an open source live streaming software.Languages used are java and 
scala.Kafka is a messaging system in which the message is transferred through
two ways:Point to point messaging system and Publish subscribe messaging system.
Producer transfers the data which is divided according to the topics and then 
the partitions are made according to the topic and finally the data is send to
the consumer.The number of partitions is decided by the user.There are brokers
which keeps the data present in the partitions.Kafka provides fault tolerance.
Point to point:In this system,if there are topics a,b and c and consumers 1,2
and 3 then if topic c is send to consumer 1 then it loses its identity and 
cannot be send to any other consumer.Similarly for b and a.
Publish subscribe:In this system,the topic does not loses its identity and if
it has been sent to one consumer then also it can be send to the other 
consumers as well.
    If partitions>brokers,then any of the broker will store the partition in 
it.If brokers>partitiions,then all the partitions are filled in the brokers and
the remaining brokers are left empty.
    Among all the brokers,a leader is decided which is done with the help of
zookeeper(a project of Apache).Polling of all the brokers is done and acc. to
the results,the zookeeper declares the result.THe rest of the brokers become
the followers.
    If the leader fails,then any of the followers become the leader.
    Zookeeper keeps the track of the active node and the dead node as well.It 
also decides which node will replace the dead node.
