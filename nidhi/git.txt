Git is a command line interface(CLI) tool.It is a distributed version control system.It is free and open source.It can have multiple
branches which are independent of each other.The branch on which we usually work is called the Master Branch.There are several other
branches as well and the master branch has the access to all those branches.
    Suppose the code is divided into branch 1,2 and 3.Now if the code in branch 1 runs correctly then the master branch will merge the 
branch else it will delete that branch.Similarly for branch  2 and 3 also.

Few of the git coommands are as follows:

git init:it is used to start a new repository
git commit -m:it records or snapshots the file permanently so that we can see the changes in the file.  
git add .:adds the files
git add -a:adds two files
git status:list all the files that have to be commited
git log:shows the history of the current branch 
git branch:shows in which branch you are 
git checkout -b branchname:creates a new branch and switches to it
git checkout branchname:switches to that branch
git push origin branchname:this command sends the changes in the branch to the repository
git stash:stores all the modified tracked files
git rm file:deletes the file from your working directory
git clone url:use to clone a repository from the given url into the directory
