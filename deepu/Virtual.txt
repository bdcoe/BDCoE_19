Virtual works as illusion for computer.
Using Virtualisation we can run different Opeating system on other operating system.
there are two type of Virtualisation Type 1,Type 2.
In Type 1 we have,
Hardware -> Operating system -> Hypervisor -> Operating system
In type 2 we have,
Hardware -> Hypervisor -> Operating System.

Generally,we preferred type 2 virtualisation as in it there is no fear of lossing data on ur genuine operating system.In this,only require part of memory is used.
