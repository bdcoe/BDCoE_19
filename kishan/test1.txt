Today,We learn about Hadoop
1.HDFS allows to dump any kind of data across the cluster
2.MapReduce allows parallel processing of data stored in HDFS.
Hadoop Ecosystem-
1.Flume-used to inject data in HDFS
2.Sqoop-used to inject structured data in HDFS
3.YARN-Brain of ecosystem:performs processing activities
4.HIVE-Analytical SQL on hadoop
5.Spark-real time processing
6.Pig-analyse large data set
